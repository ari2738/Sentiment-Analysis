# Sentiment-Analysis
The Advanced Sentiment Analysis System is a Python-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that analyzes user-entered text and determines the emotional tone of the sentence. The system classifies the input as Positive, Negative, or Neutral and also provides a confidence percentage based on polarity score.
